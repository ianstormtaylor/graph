# graph

  Graph anything easily.

  Work in progress. It's a Phonegap app that lets you graph things by just entering a data point every day (or hour, whatever) over time. Things like body weight, number of guns in your nerf collection, how many pushups you can do, etc.

  **[Naming ideas]() very welcome!** Everything in the world is taken :(
